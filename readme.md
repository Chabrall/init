# __init__, based on HTML5 Boilerplate

This project extends [HTML5 Boilerpalte](https://github.com/h5bp/html5-boilerplate) with some more structure for SCSS files and JavaScripts.


## General
Please use the `.editorconfig`-file in order to set the right usage of tabs/spaces in your editor. Visit [editorconfig.org](http://editorconfig.org/) for more information.

## CSS
We are currently working with [SASS](http://sass-lang.com/) (in its dialect SCSS) and do not use CSS directly. Please do not edit the CSS-files in any case but search the correct `.scss` file and edit the according SCSS. If you are not familiar with SCSS you can write pure CSS which is actually valid SCSS.

However all `.scss`-files are compiled into one file called `style.css` in the `css`-folder. This is the only file that is relevant for uploading and including into the page.

You can find more information about the installation process of SASS and the usage of SCSS in the [SASS Tutorial](http://sass-lang.com/tutorial.html).


## JS
We use jQuery and Modernizr (custom build).
Please lint your JavaScript before commit.

## Deployment
Please use [grunt.js](https://github.com/cowboy/grunt) for deployment. The `grunt.js`-file has tasks for concatenating and minifing CSS and JavaScript.
Additional information on this project is stored in `package.json`.
